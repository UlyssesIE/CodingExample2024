# CodingExample2025

This repository contains two Python backend services designed to power intelligent information retrieval for frontend applications. Both services interact with a vector database (Elasticsearch) to find relevant information based on user questions, construct prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs), and stream the LLM's responses back to the frontend. One service utilizes Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming, while the other employs WebSockets.


**Features**
Intelligent Information Retrieval: Leverage a vector database (Elasticsearch) for efficient and relevant information retrieval based on natural language questions.
LLM Integration: Dynamically generate LLM prompts using retrieved information, enabling context-aware responses.
Streaming Responses: Provide a real-time, interactive user experience by streaming LLM outputs to frontend applications.
Dual Streaming Mechanisms: Choose between Server-Sent Events (SSE) and WebSockets for your frontend communication needs.
Architecture Overview
Both backend services follow a similar architectural pattern:

Frontend Request: A frontend application sends a user question to one of the backend services.
Vector Database Search (Elasticsearch): The backend service queries Elasticsearch (acting as a vector database) to find documents or information semantically similar to the user's question.
LLM Prompt Construction: The retrieved information is used to construct a comprehensive prompt for an LLM. This prompt typically includes the user's question and the context from Elasticsearch.
LLM Interaction: The prompt is sent to an LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, etc. - specify if you're using a particular one).
Streaming Output: The LLM's response is streamed back to the frontend using either SSE or WebSockets, providing a continuous flow of information as it becomes available.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the backend services up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Pip (Python package installer)
Elasticsearch instance (local or remote)
Access to an LLM API (e.g., API key for OpenAI, Google Cloud, etc.)
Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Configuration
Create a .env file in the root of each service's directory (e.g., sse_service/.env and websocket_service/.env) and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials and settings.

Example .env file:

ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=localhost
ELASTICSEARCH_PORT=9200
ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX=your_vector_index_name
LLM_API_KEY=your_llm_api_key
LLM_MODEL_NAME=gpt-3.5-turbo # Or your preferred LLM model
ELASTICSEARCH_HOST: The hostname or IP address of your Elasticsearch instance.
ELASTICSEARCH_PORT: The port your Elasticsearch instance is listening on.
ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX: The name of the index in Elasticsearch where your vectorized information is stored.
LLM_API_KEY: Your API key for the LLM service you are using.
LLM_MODEL_NAME: The specific model ID of the LLM you want to use (e.g., text-davinci-003, gpt-4, gemini-pro).
Running the Services
You can run each service independently.

Running the SSE Service
Navigate to the sse_service directory and run:

Bash

cd sse_service
python app.py
The SSE service will typically run on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or whatever port you configure).

Running the WebSocket Service
Navigate to the websocket_service directory and run:

Bash

cd websocket_service
python app.py
The WebSocket service will typically run on ws://127.0.0.1:8000 (or whatever port you configure).

API Endpoints
SSE Service
Endpoint: /stream_question
Method: POST
Content-Type: application/json

Request Body Example:

JSON

{
    "question": "What is the capital of France?"
}
Response:
A stream of server-sent events, where each event contains a chunk of the LLM's response.

Example SSE Event:

data: {"chunk": "Paris"}
WebSocket Service
Endpoint: /ws
Method: WebSocket

Communication Flow:

Establish Connection: A frontend WebSocket client connects to ws://localhost:8000/ws.

Send Question: Once connected, the frontend sends a JSON message containing the question.

Example Question Message:

JSON

{
    "type": "question",
    "payload": "Tell me about the history of artificial intelligence."
}
Receive Streaming Response: The backend will then send back a series of JSON messages, each containing a chunk of the LLM's response.

Example Response Message:

JSON

{
    "type": "response_chunk",
    "payload": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has a long and fascinating history, dating back to antiquity..."
}
A final message will be sent to indicate the end of the stream:

JSON

{
    "type": "response_end"
}
